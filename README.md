# Features
Convert between various image, audio and video formats using the context menu. The addon is written in Python and available for **Nautilus**, **Nemo**, **Thunar** and **Dolphin** file viewers. It adds a new option to the context menu to create an easy way to convert between a huge amount of file types.
The program offers many options to customize the appearance of its context menu. There are also a few extra formats which can be added by installing optional dependencies.
The tool has a built-in auto-update function to make sure the newest version is always installed.
