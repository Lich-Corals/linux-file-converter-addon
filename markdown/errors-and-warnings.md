### (003): No permission to self-update
<b>Causes:</b><br/>
The program has no permission to write it's own file.
<br/>This warning usually occurs when the script is located at "/usr/share/nautilus-python/extensions/".
<br/><br/><b>Possible Effects:</b><br/>
The self-update function will not be available.
<br/>The script may show the releases page on multiple startups if self-update isn't disabled.
<br/><br/><b>How to solve?</b><br/>
To remove the release popup, you may disable the corresponding setting. To do this, please follow the instructions on the [configuration page](https://github.com/Lich-Corals/linux-file-converter-addon/blob/main/markdown/configuration.md).
<br/>To get self updates, the script needs the permissions to write to itself. This can be done by changing the file permissions using [chmod](https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/chmod.1.html) or by running the script as a privileged user.
<br/>To be able to self-update, the user, who is executing the script (by starting Nautilus) needs permissions to edit the script itself.

### (004): No permission to write configuration file
<b>Causes:</b><br/>
The program has no permission to write in the dictionary where it is installed.
<br/>This warning usually occurs when the script is located at "/usr/share/nautilus-python/extensions/".
<br/><br/><b>Possible Effects:</b><br/>
The self-update function may not be available.
<br/>The script needs to be configured by editing the script itself.
<br/>If self-updating is enabled, the script's configuration will reset when a update is performed.
<br/><br/><b>How to solve?</b><br/>
To fix this, the script needs the permissions to write inside the folder, where it is located. This can be done by changing the folder permissions using [chmod](https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/chmod.1.html) or by running the script as a privileged user.
<br/>To use the configuration file, the user, who is executing the script (by starting Nautilus) needs permissions create and edit files inside the installation dictionary.
<br/><br/>To prevent the settings from being reset, you can add a config file to the dictionary. Note that the file will not be update if new configurations are added.

### (005): Double script installation detected
<b>Causes:</b><br/>
The script is installed in a home location and finds another script with the same name in the root installation folder ("/usr/share/nautilus-python/extensions/").
<br/><br/><b>Possible Effects:</b><br/>
The context menu may appear two times.
<br/><br/><b>How to solve?</b><br/>
To solve this issue, you have to remove one of the files (in "/usr/share/nautilus-python/extensions/" or in "~/.local/share/nautilus-python/extensions/")

### (006): Attempting to update
<b>Causes:</b><br/>
Automatic updates are enabled and there are updates available.
This is not an error, just information to make problems easier to solve.
