# Configuration
The program can be configured using the  ~/.config/linux-file-converter-addon/config.json file, which will be created when the script is executed for the first time, as long as the program is able to write in the ~/.config directory.
Just modify the file, by changing the 'true' and 'false' values.
This configuration should apply to all installations of linux-file-converter-addon at once.

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> Don't forget to save your changes, and restart Nautilus after modifying the configuration!
> Relaunching is not necessary when using the adaption version for another program.
>
> ```bash
> #Quit Nautilus
> nautilus -q
>
> #start it again, you can also use the normal launcher.
> nohup nautilus & disown
> ```

## Automatic updates
Automatic updates are only working in the home dictionary. If you've installed the script at the system-wide location, you may turn off automatic updates.
<br/><br/>To <b>turn off automatic updates</b>, open the config file with a text editor and set the `automaticUpdates` variable to 'false'.
To <b>manually trigger a self-update</b>, just open the .py file with a text editor and change the value of the `converterVersion` variable.
To turn off the <b>update pop-up</b>, open the config file with a text editor and set the `showPatchNotes` variable to 'false'.

## Shown menu items
To turn off the <b>patch note button</b> in the context menu and the <b>version number</b> in the adaption window, open the config file with a text editor and set the `showPatchNoteButton` variable to 'false'.
<br/><br/>To turn off the <b>Configure NFC43 button</b> in the context menu and the <b>config hint</b> in the adaption window, open the config file with a text editor and set the `showConfigHint` variable to 'false'.
<br/><br/>To turn off the '<b>convert to square</b>' option, open the config file with a text editor and set the `convertToSquares` variable to 'false'.
<br/><br/>To turn off the '<b>convert to wallpaper</b>' functions, open the config file with a text editor and set the `convertToLandscapeWallpapers` and-or the `convertToPortraitWallpapers` variable to 'false'.

> [!NOTE]  
> If you still have the `convertToWallpapers` option in your config.json file, you may remove it; it was replaced by the two options above and does not change anything anymore.

## Other options
To turn off the __addition of timestamps__ to filenames, open the config file with a text editor and set the `timeInNames` variable to ‘false’.
<br/><br/>To turn off the <b>"Conversion finished" notifications</b>, open the config file with a text editor and set the `displayFinishNotification` variable to 'false'.

## Adaption specific options (Nemo and Thunar)
<br/>To enable the conversion of <b>application/octet-stream</b> files in the adaption version, set the `convertFromOctetStream` option to 'true'. This may allow you to convert files with unmatching mimetypes, which are in a supported- but not as such detected format. This may also allow the context menu option for other un-convertabe files, such a pdf or zip.

To disable the <b>"-" option</b> in the dropdown-list, set the `showDummyOption` setting to 'false'.

If the program does not automatically generate or update the nemo_action file, you can enable the `alwaysCreateNemoAction` option to override the check if the program is installed for Nemo. 

> [!WARNING]  
> The configuration is used globally; hence, other installations of the file converter (for Nautilus or Thunar) will also generate a nemo_action in their current directory if this option is enabled.
> <br/>To avoid this, enable this option, run the extension in Nemo once and finally disable the option again.
